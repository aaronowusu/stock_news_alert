# Stock News Alert ðŸ“ˆ

A Python Script that sends text messages of the latest news articles relating to a stock when its price has moved by a specific percentage within the past day.


## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Make sure you have the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your computer (verify that the correct OS has been selected). 
* In order to get a text message sent to your phone, you'll need to sign up to [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio).
* Once you've made an account, replace the placeholders in main.py with your **Virtual Twilio Number** and your own mobile number after it's been verified.
* Locate your free **Twilio API key, Twilio SID and Authentication Token** and copy all of them into their desginated places in main.py.
* You'll also need to obtain your own stock and news API keys by registering on [ALPHA VANTAGE](https://www.alphavantage.co) and [NEWSAPI](https://newsapi.org) respectively.
* Once you've registed on both plaforms, copy the stock and news API keys into main.py

### Installing and Running the program

* Download and extract the ZIP file from the [repository](https://github.com/aaronowusu/stock_news_alert.git).
* Make sure that you have replaced all the placeholders with your details.
